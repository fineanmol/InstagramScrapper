# instasave

I made this app in 2016 to learn android studio and android app development. I used java alongside android studio and developed this app aiming to run in android 4.4.2.

App is simple, main purpose of this app is saving public images in instagram. You can share images directly from instagram app to this app or simply copy and past url of image to app. Another features are, seeing last 10 or so photos of an account and downloading them multiply. User can see profile pictures of public profiles too and can download them.
